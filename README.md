# Sandmiles-Database-Project Report Summary
This is a database design project for a fictitous Canadian wholesale electronics company called Sandmiles Group founded in 2019. Since
inception, the company has used a file-based database system. In the early years of business, this was effective and efficient. However, the company has grown and so has its data. The manager has noticed that with the file-based database system, keeping track of the company’s operations has become more time-consuming and there have been a lot of errors. There have also been security issues as well as data redundancy issues. All these have prevented the
company from using its data efficiently to drive decision making.

The manager wants to improve:

> • Data access

> • Data integrity

>• End user productivity

>• Data security

Overall, she wants Sandmiles Group to develop a data driven culture in order to improve
efficiency, customer satisfaction, staff engagement and make better informed decisions. To
achieve this, the manager has requested that the company’s file-based database be converted
to a Relational Database Management System. We are therefore designing a database for the
Employees, Department, Customers, Products and Sales.
